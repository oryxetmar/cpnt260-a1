3. Reflection:
- i spent at least 3-4 hours trying to figure out how to centre align text. i am not kidding. i was very shaky with flexbox and i wasnt understanding the process very well. around 7:30pm yesterday i made a discovery!! 
- display: flex;  - this is necessary IT IS V NECESSARY
- i used the dev tools to correct bugs and that was so helpful as well, just to understand what was preventing movements or additions when i felt confused about what wasnt working like i wanted it to
